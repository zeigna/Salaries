# Salaries

This is the file for my MAT 327 class.  I needed a .csv file with at least 1 nominal/categorical variable and at least 3 numerical/quantitative variables.

Next is to meet the milestones required on the dataset: 

Dataset: salaries.csv (from ed.gov, I believe)

n=397 cases
variables:
rank: ordinal (levels:  AssocProf, AsstProf, Prof)
discipline: nominal (levels:  A--> "theoretical" departments B --> "applied" departments )
yrs.since.phd: ratio
yrs.service: ratio
sex (which I should rename gender): nominal
salary: given in dollars; ratio

***************
Milestone 3:  Read in .csv file, compute means and standard deviations

Milestone 4: Plotting numerical data
